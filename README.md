# Responsive Images: Project Part 1 #

DEMO: [https://sunnymui.github.io/Responsive-One-Page-Static-Site/](https://sunnymui.github.io/Responsive-One-Page-Static-Site/)

For this project, I took some basic provided and unstyled page and made it into a more complete styled fully responsive single page static site. 

Placeholder text used.

Images are fully responsive using CSS, srcset, and art direction via the picture element. Grunt tasks were used to automate responsive image generation and compression. Art directed photos were cropped manually using Photoshop. Picture fill polyfill used for older browsers.
